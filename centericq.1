\fBcentericq\fP is a text mode menu- and window-driven IM interface.
Currently ICQ2000, Yahoo!, MSN and AIM protocols are supported. It allows you
to send, receive, and forward messages, URLs, SMSes and, contacts, mass
message send, search for users (including extended "whitepages search"), view
users' details, maintain your contact list directly from the program (including
non-icq contacts), view the messages history, register a new UIN and update
your details, be informed on receiving email messages, automatically set away
after the defined period of inactivity (on any console), and have your own
ignore, visible and invisible lists. It can also associate events with
sounds, add events to the outgoing queue from command line, define external
event processing actions (like events auto-forwarding or elizatalk), has
support for Hebrew and Arabic languages and allows to arrange contacts into
groups.

.PP

The following commands are used to put events to the outgoing queue from
the command line. If centericq is already running they're to be sent
immediately, otherwise they will be sent as soon as you go online.


.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-send\fR <event type>
This parameter specifies the type of event you want to send.
Currently only "msg", "url" and "sms" are supported.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-proto\fR <protocol type>
This one specifies to which IM network the destination contact
beyongs. Can be "icq", "yahoo", "aim" or "msn".
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-to\fR <nickname or UIN>
Finally, with this one you specify nickname or UIN of the
destination contact. For icq it's possible to specify 0 to send
events to yourself. Only SMSes are known to be possible to be sent
to oneself though.

.PP

The message text is read from the standard input, so use pipes in shell
to pass it. For example, you can say "hi" to me through the ICQ network
with the following command:

    \fB$ echo "hi" | centericq -s msg -p icq -t 17502151\fR

In case you want to send an URL, the URL itself and its description are
separated with a newline character the following way:

    \fB$ echo -e "http://konst.org.ua/\\nMy modest homepage." \
    | centericq -s url -p icq -t 17502151\fR

Please note, that all three parameters are required in order to queue an
event.
