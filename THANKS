There is a list of people who I want to say thanks for their contributions
into the development of centericq.

Bertram Bourdrez <bourdrez@casema.net>

    For code contributions. He's the one who implemented collapsable
    groups.

And here are the authors of IM protocols handling code I used.

    Barnaby Gray <barnaby@beedesign.co.uk>      ICQ
    Shane P. Brady <shane@jxie.com>             MSN
