# it the following parameters can be used:

# Specifying several event types is also supported.
#
# proto

# can be used as a synonim for all of them.
#
# status

# Can be "online", "away", "dnd", "na", "occupied", "ffc" or "invisible".
# Specifying several ones is possible. "all" stands for all of possible

#
# options
# -------
# Possible options for an action are:
#
#       stdin           The incoming message text is to be passed to
#                       stdin of the script to be executed.
#
#       stdout          The script output is to be sent as a reply
#                       message (if not empty).
#
# Then, the section named "%exec" should follow. It contains a piece of
# script to be executed being copied to a file first.
