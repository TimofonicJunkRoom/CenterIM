Nothing, I just come back a few hours later and find a barrage of messages
because it's gone from away, NA or invisible back to online.

Yes, it stays off-line. It's only in modes like away, NA and invisible.
After a few hours they seem to go back to online. Same with restarting the

this seems similar to mirabilis icq group mode 2, which i suggested
a while ago. i'd also be happy about it.

I'm thinking, like, you can have regex's run on the message body & type,
and if they match, it pipes it into a perl instance.. I have some experience
with this..might give it a go..
