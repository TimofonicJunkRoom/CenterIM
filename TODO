crap in msn messages


I've been having a problem compiling releases on Solaris 8 using gcc.
The following files all try to include "_G_config.h" which, being a
GNU libc specific header file, does not exist on my system. I have no
problems building if I just comment out that line, which makes me
wonder, is this include really necessary on any platform, even the ones
with GNU libc?

The problem files are:

kkstrtext/conf.h
kksystr/include/conf.h
kkconsui/include/conf.h
