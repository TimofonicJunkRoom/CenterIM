http(s) connect method

 Follows is an example of the CONNECT method, going to a correctly configured proxy:

>>> $ telnet oblivion.its.uq.edu.au 8080
<<< Trying 130.102.152.116...
<<< Connected to oblivion.its.uq.edu.au.
<<< Escape character is '^]'.
>>> CONNECT smtp.uq.edu.au:25 HTTP/1.0
>>>
<<< HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden
<<< Server: Squid/2.4.STABLE4
<<< Mime-Version: 1.0
<<< Date: Tue, 15 Oct 2002 00:24:57 GMT
<<< Content-Type: text/html
<<< Content-Length: 696
<<< Expires: Tue, 15 Oct 2002 00:24:57 GMT
<<< X-Squid-Error: ERR_ACCESS_DENIED 0
<<< X-Cache: MISS from oblivion
<<< Proxy-Connection: close

	.
	. HTML Cut for clarity.
	.
			
<<< Connection closed by foreign host.
<<< $ 

Follows is the same proxy server badly configured and therefore open:

>>> $ telnet oblivion.its.uq.edu.au 8080
<<< Trying 130.102.152.116...
<<< Connected to oblivion.its.uq.edu.au.
<<< Escape character is '^]'.
>>> CONNECT smtp.uq.edu.au:25 HTTP/1.0
>>>
<<< HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established
<<<
<<< 220 bunyip.cc.uq.edu.au ESMTP Sendmail 8.9.3/8.9.3; Tue, 15 Oct 2002 10:46:23 (GMT)
>>> QUIT
<<< 221 bunyip.cc.uq.edu.au closing connection
<<< Connection closed by foreign host.
<<< $
