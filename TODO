libiconv is not linked

The problem is that in the Join Channel selection dialog, the "service"
reads the name of the service (e.g. "Text Conferencing") rather than the
jid (e.g. "conference.jabber.com"). Well, maybe that's not a problem, but

http(s) connect method

 Follows is an example of the CONNECT method, going to a correctly configured proxy:

>>> $ telnet oblivion.its.uq.edu.au 8080
<<< Trying 130.102.152.116...
<<< Connected to oblivion.its.uq.edu.au.
<<< Escape character is '^]'.
>>> CONNECT smtp.uq.edu.au:25 HTTP/1.0
>>>
<<< HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden
<<< Server: Squid/2.4.STABLE4
<<< Mime-Version: 1.0
<<< Date: Tue, 15 Oct 2002 00:24:57 GMT
<<< Content-Type: text/html
<<< Content-Length: 696
<<< Expires: Tue, 15 Oct 2002 00:24:57 GMT
<<< X-Squid-Error: ERR_ACCESS_DENIED 0
<<< X-Cache: MISS from oblivion
<<< Proxy-Connection: close

	.
	. HTML Cut for clarity.
	.
			
<<< Connection closed by foreign host.
<<< $ 

Follows is the same proxy server badly configured and therefore open:

>>> $ telnet oblivion.its.uq.edu.au 8080
<<< Trying 130.102.152.116...
<<< Connected to oblivion.its.uq.edu.au.
<<< Escape character is '^]'.
>>> CONNECT smtp.uq.edu.au:25 HTTP/1.0
>>>
<<< HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established
<<<
<<< 220 bunyip.cc.uq.edu.au ESMTP Sendmail 8.9.3/8.9.3; Tue, 15 Oct 2002 10:46:23 (GMT)
>>> QUIT
<<< 221 bunyip.cc.uq.edu.au closing connection
<<< Connection closed by foreign host.
<<< $ 

specific status lists for every protocol, extend the standard statuses

jabber connect problem. if the server replies nothing, it stucks the
whole program

stupid conversation logs

try to implement the daemon mode
    substitute another "face" class
	hooks call only face.log && update methods
