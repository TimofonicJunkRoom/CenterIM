1.I've just read through the README an saw this statement "The commands from "actions"
run in parallel with centericq, so please only pass your URLs to scripts
or to X based browsers, but to nothing interactive." I've found a solution for it:
My CenterICQ is running under a screen and my actions file looks like this:
openurl screen lynx $url$
so when I press F2 it just opens another screen and CenterICQ doesn't crash.
