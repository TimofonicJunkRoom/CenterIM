"relaxed" re-connect timing

todo and reminders

I'm thinking, like, you can have regex's run on the message body & type,
and if they match, it pipes it into a perl instance.. I have some experience
with this..might give it a go..

1.I've just read through the README an saw this statement "The commands from "actions"
run in parallel with centericq, so please only pass your URLs to scripts
or to X based browsers, but to nothing interactive." I've found a solution for it:
My CenterICQ is running under a screen and my actions file looks like this:
openurl screen lynx $url$
so when I press F2 it just opens another screen and CenterICQ doesn't crash.
