something's wrong with sprintf and msn

contrib/ doesn't go to rpm dists

X window resize -> sometimes segfaults

MSN: 3rd person invitation from other party -> centericq segfault

When somebody with a "real" msn client closes my message window, my
centericq shows that user as being offline. (because msn sends a "bye"
command when closing the message window). After going offline and online
again, the user is back. This happens every time, and my current solution
is to ask the other site NOT to close their window but minimize it. (very
frustrating to explain why this is neccesary to the avarage windows user ;-)

1.I've just read through the README an saw this statement "The commands from "actions"
run in parallel with centericq, so please only pass your URLs to scripts
or to X based browsers, but to nothing interactive." I've found a solution for it:
My CenterICQ is running under a screen and my actions file looks like this:
openurl screen lynx $url$
so when I press F2 it just opens another screen and CenterICQ doesn't crash.
