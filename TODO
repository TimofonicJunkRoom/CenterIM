DONE

kxicq2 and gnomeicu support in cicqconv
there is no "send contacts" item in f2 menu :(
allows to modify details after 3 (?) enter presses on the dialog fields
"add to contact list" in non-icq -> gotta ask group
apply patch from kapuzin
cicqconv : ok, but all the messages are unread :)
check for curses lib

kktoolbox: template for trees, menus, and other stuff, to make it able
to hold various kinds of data associated with items

todo and reminders

chat req and cancel. segfault
cannot resolve the server from the first time -> lotta sockets

I'm thinking, like, you can have regex's run on the message body & type,
and if they match, it pipes it into a perl instance.. I have some experience
with this..might give it a go..
