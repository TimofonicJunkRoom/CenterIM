unsent msgs counter

i just started centericq and i got a empty message from someone who
wasn't in my list when i wanted to look in the history of this person, i
got a segmentation fault

netscape -remote -- browser execution on urls
"/" to search the contact list
sort-by-who-last-send-an-event

ssh auto-away?

ctrl-y and other editor commands -> FAQ
emacs key-bindings
copy to gpm buffer
launch programs
alt-s in multiple selection

I'm thinking, like, you can have regex's run on the message body & type,
and if they match, it pipes it into a perl instance.. I have some experience
with this..might give it a go..
