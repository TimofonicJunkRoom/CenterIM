So, there is no abbreviation for 'occupied'.

Shells others than /bin/sh don't work in external.

When an ICQ2000 user sends me a contact, while I don't use centericq,
centericq crashes during start up (Segmentation fault after writing
[icq] logged in). If the same user sends me a contact, while I'm online,
everything works as it should.

server hostname guess from the JID

jabber headlines

msn smses, file transfers

IP addresses binding

stupid conversation logs

sending e-mail from centericq directly?

scriptable protocols actions

try to implement the daemon mode
    substitute another "face" class
