this seems similar to mirabilis icq group mode 2, which i suggested
a while ago. i'd also be happy about it.

icq починить file send

auto-respond

how to use cicqsync -> to the doc

"relaxed" re-connect timing

login/logout history

hold some user info locally so that to be able to send "you were added"
in correct way

update security info

try to make msgs to go in order of being written
control the contact list having been sent

todo and reminders

chat req and cancel. segfault
cannot resolve the server from the first time -> lotta sockets

ctrl-y and other editor commands -> FAQ
emacs key-bindings
launch programs

I'm thinking, like, you can have regex's run on the message body & type,
and if they match, it pipes it into a perl instance.. I have some experience
with this..might give it a go..
