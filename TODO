this seems similar to mirabilis icq group mode 2, which i suggested
a while ago. i'd also be happy about it.

auto-respond

how to use cicqsync -> to the doc

"relaxed" re-connect timing

login/logout history

todo and reminders

launch programs

I'm thinking, like, you can have regex's run on the message body & type,
and if they match, it pipes it into a perl instance.. I have some experience
with this..might give it a go..

Hi konst,

fist of all thanks for CenterICQ its the best ICQ program if ever used!

1.I've just read through the README an saw this statement "The commands from "actions"
run in parallel with centericq, so please only pass your URLs to scripts
or to X based browsers, but to nothing interactive." I've found a solution for it:
My CenterICQ is running under a screen and my actions file looks like this:
openurl screen lynx $url$
so when I press F2 it just opens another screen and CenterICQ doesn't crash.
