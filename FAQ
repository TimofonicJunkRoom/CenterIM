Q: "Who are you?" - a question usually addressed to the user "konst"
   on the default centericq contact list by everybody who doesn't
   like to read documentation.

A: I usually answer "Santa Claus".

Q: What is the "ICQ" contact list item?

A: It's a special kind of contact you receive system messages from.
   For example, someone has requested your authorization to add you
   to his contact list or someone has added you. You'll be noticed
   with that item.

Q: How can I request someone's authorization to add him to my
   contact list?

A: There is no need to ask for authorization to add somebody with
   centericq ;) It adds people quietly.

Q: What about implementing such a neat <blah-blah> feature in centericq?

A: Hey, centericq is GPL and opensource, so feel free to contribute.
   Don't wait for the author/maintainer to implement it, just do it
   yourself and send a patch.

Q: Can't build it under FreeBSD..

A: Use gmake instead of make

Q: (by Paonia Ezrine, paonia@home.welcomehome.org)
   When I run centericq in a xterm or from the console it is fine but
   when I run it in a gnome terminal windows the screen does not update
   correctly. Specificly the right side of the screen does not get
   cleared after I send a message or other similar events.

A: (by Jakub Travnik, j.travnik@sh.cvut.cz)

   It happens only with the gnome-terminal. centericq works fine on
   linux-console and eterm (enlightenment) so it is problem with
   gnome-terminal. It does not support all xterm sequences.
   /usr/share/terminfo/g/gnome file could correct that (gnome users
   should have it), so that ncurses will not use such a extended
   sequences for gnome-terminal.

   Workaround: For me it worked setting TERM variable to gnome and then
   running centericq without problems.
   
   (gnome-terminal)
   $ export TERM=gnome
   $ centericq
   
   and it is ok

Q: How do I authorize someone's request with centericq?

A: You'll see as soon as someone requests it.
