Hello. I'm glad to present you my program, centerICQ. It's an ICQ
client program for Linux, known to work under FreeBSD and OpenBSD as
well. You should just take a look at its work screen to realize that
you've never seen the same program before. If one of the reasons you
like Linux for is the possibility to work only in text mode, you'll like
it.

Here is the list of most intresting features of centerICQ.
With this program you're able to:

- have useful text mode menu- and window-driven interface
- view contact list as a menu
- send/receive messages, URLs, files and contacts
- view messages history
- search for users, view users' details
- register new UINs
- maintain your contact list directly from the program
- be informed when your mailbox is replanished with new messages
- automatically set Away and then N/A after defined period of inactivity
- have your own ignore list
- forward messages
- associate events with sounds
- send mass messages
- add non-icq contacts to your list

Also, if you have a soundcard, you can examine $(HOME)/.centericq/sound file
that you'll find there after installation to learn how to set sounds for
events and customize it for users personally.

Feel free to contact me with e-mail at konst@konst.org.ua if you have any
comments or suggestions about this program and not only about it.

Also it's strongly recommended to read the FAQ file included into the
distribution.
